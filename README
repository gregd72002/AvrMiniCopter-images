***** AvrMiniCopter *****


WHAT IS IT
===========================
AvrMiniCopter will turn your Raspberry Pi or any SPI capable device into a quadcopter controller with the help of Arduino Pro Mini.

This repository contains precompiled AvrMiniCopter: 
- raspberrypi.zip - Raspberry Pi image, a custom linux build that contains programs you need to setup and fly a quadcopter
- arduino.hex - Arduino Pro Mini firmware 


MAIN FEATURES
===========================
- 2 fly modes - Auto-level & Acro
- Altitude hold
- learner mode (attach 2 controller simultaneously - one for the teacher and one for the learner)
- HD FPV (with Android device)
- Wifi support
- fast (boot time of around 2-3sec)
- small size (~200Mbytes for RPi image and <32Kbytes for arduino image)
- stabilization done in 200Hz (limit of MPU6050 DMP)
- WWW configurable (i.e. you can adjust anything by using your phone)
- Camera support for taking pictures and videos
- Support for quadcopters in X configuration of any size
- Bluetooth and USB controller support (i.e. PS3 gamepad)
- Log charting
- Live/real-time charting 
- ESC calibration
- Based on MPU6050/MPU9150 gyroscope
- BMP085 / BMP180 barometer
- Flight log
- Out of box bluetooth (PAN) and WIFI connectivity for receiving flight logs, accessing the file system (NFS and SSH), browsing videos and pictures


REQUIREMENTS
===========================
- Raspberry Pi or Odroid (tested on model A and B and Odroid-W)
- SD card minimum 256MB size
- optionally PS3 controller with Bluetooth 2.1 USB dongle (you can use your keyboard if you really want)
- optionally Wifi USB dongle and an Android device
- AVR board (tested on Arduino Pro Mini 16MHz)
- MPU6050/MPU9150 breakout board
- BMP085/BMP180 breakout board
- Quadcopter
	- Frame
	- 4 x ESC (if without BEC than external UBEC is needed)
	- 4 x Motors
	- Battery
	- some cables
