***** AvrMiniCopter *****


WHAT IS IT
===========================
This is an image of AvrMiniCopter, which will turn your Raspberry Pi or any SPI capable device into a simple quadcopter controller board with the help of Arduino Pro Mini. This is a custom linux build that contains everything you need to setup and fly a X quadcopter.



MAIN FEATURES
===========================
- 2 fly modes - Auto-level & Acro
- Altitude hold
- learner mode (attach 2 controller simultaneously - one for the teacher and one for the learner)
- very fast (boot time of around 2-3sec)
- small size (~150Mbytes)
- stabilization done in 200Hz (limit of MPU6050)
- WWW configurable (i.e. you can adjust anything by using your phone)
- Camera support for taking pictures and videos
- Support for quadcopters in X configuration of any size
- Bluetooth and USB controller support (i.e. PS3 gamepad)
- Log charting
- ESC calibration
- Based on MPU6050/MPU9150 gyroscope
- BMP085 / BMP180 barometer
- Flight log
- Out of box bluetooth connectivity (PAN) for receiving flight logs, accessing the file system (NFS and SSH), browsing videos and pictures


REQUIREMENTS
===========================
- Raspberry Pi (tested on model A and B as well as Odroid-W)
- SD card minimum 256MB size
- PS3 controller
- Bluetooth 2.1 USB dongle
- AVR board (tested on Arduino Pro Mini 16MHz)
- MPU6050/MPU9150 breakout board
- BMP085/BMP180 breakout board
- Quadcopter
	- Frame
	- 4 x ESC (if without BEC than external UBEC is needed)
	- 4 x Motors
	- Battery
	- some cables
